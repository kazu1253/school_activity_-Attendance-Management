# school_activity_-Attendance-Management



I decided to build an attendance automation tool because managing attendance manually was taking too much time and often caused small mistakes. In our daily routine, attendance needed to be recorded quickly and accurately, but writing names, checking lists, and updating records by hand made the process inefficient.

I also noticed that the work became harder when there were absences, late arrivals, or changes that needed to be reflected in the record. Since the same steps were repeated every time, I felt that the process could be improved by automation.

Therefore, I created a tool that automatically organizes attendance data and reduces the amount of manual input. My goal was to make attendance management faster, more reliable, and easier for everyone involved. Through this project, I aimed to solve a real problem in our environment using programming.
